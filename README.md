The other property like subtitles and previews is optional. Just the source property is required.

```typescript
import "kaldiras/kaldiras.css";
import { Video } from "kaldiras";

const App = () => {
  return(
    <Video
    sources={[
      {
        source: "https://.../480p.mp4",
        type: "video/mp4",
        resolution: "1080"
      }
    ]}
    subtitles={[
      {
        label: "English",
        lang: "en",
        source: "https://.../en.vtt",
        default: true
      }
    ]}
    previews={[
      {
